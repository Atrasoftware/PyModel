bin directory
=============

This directory contains the commands for PyModel.

To use PyModel, this directory must be on your execution *PATH*.
Or, its contents must be installed in some directory that is on your
execution *PATH*.

There are two versions of some commands.  The version without a file
type is a *bash* script for Unix/Linux/Mac; the version with *.bat* is
a batch file for Windows.  There are no Windows versions of some
commands.

The commands are:

- *pma*, *pmg*, *pmt*, *pmv*: the four main PyModel commands.  They
  just invoke the Python modules with the same names in the *pymodel*
  directory.  See *commands.txt* in the *notes* directory, or print
  their built-in help by typing *pma -h* etc.

- *clogdiff*: works with trun.py to execute and check
  regression tests.  See *test.txt* in the *notes* directory.

- *dotpdf*, *dotps*, *dotsvg*: invoke the Graphviz *dot* program to
  produce *.pdf*, *.ps*, or *.svg* graphics files from the *.dot*
  files generated by *pmg*

- *tpath*: put the current directory *.* (dot) on *PYTHONPATH*. This
   is needed by the PyModel programs *pmt* etc., which all import
   Python modules in the current directory that are named on the command line.
