PyModel socket sample
=====================

This sample uses network sockets to demonstrate several PyModel
techniques for modeling and testing systems that exhibit
nondeterminism, concurrency, and asynchrony.

More detailed explanation of this sample appears in *socket.txt* and
*socket_experiments.txt* in the notes directory.  This file uses
concepts and vocabulary defined in *concepts.txt* in the *notes* directory
(also *concepts.html* in the *www* directory).

Motivation
----------

Socket behavior can be more complicated than expected, because data
are buffered on each end, and may be transported through the network
at an irregular rate.  Nondeterminism arises from the unpredictable
amount of data that may be sent or received in each call.  Concurrency
arises from the simultaneous, unsynchronized sending and receiving at
the two ends of the connection.  For more explanation of socket
behavior, see:

 http://docs.python.org/howto/sockets.html

 http://pyvideo.org/video/885/through-the-ether-and-back-again-what-happens-to

This sample demonstrates how to use PyModel to model and test this
behavior, including its nondeterminism and concurrency.

Socket sample contents
----------------------

The sample includes several modules.  In this README we discuss these:

- *msocket*: a model program for network sockets that can exhibit
  nondeterminism and concurrency.

- *synchronous*, *deterministic*: a scenario machine and a
  configuration file that remove the asynchronous, nondeterministic
  behaviors of the *msocket* model program.

- *stepper*: a PyModel stepper (also called a test harness or adapter)
  that uses the *msocket* model program (and optionally, scenarios and
  configurations) to test actual sockets on *localhost* (via the Python
  standard library socket module).  Also, *stepper_util*, code used by
  the stepper.

- *observables*: a configuration file used with the stepper to indicate
  which actions in the *msocket* model program it should consider
  observable (the remaining actions are considered controllable).

- *test*, *test_viewer*, *test_stepper*: test scripts that invoke various
  combinations of these modules.

- *socket_simulator* and *select_simulator*: simulators that can
  optionally replace the Python standard library *socket* and *select*
  modules in the steppers.  The simulators can be configured to
  demonstrate a great deal of nondeterminism and concurrency, even
  with small messages.

- *fsmpy/* and *svg/* directories that contain finite state machine
  modules and graphics files generated by the test scripts from the
  *msocket* model and its scenarios and configurations.

Some other modules that also appear in this sample are explained in
*notes/socket_experiments.txt*.

Socket model program
--------------------

The model program in the *msocket* module models *both* ends of the
connection.  Here we model a system where one end of the connection is
always the sender and the other end is always the receiver: all send
actions occur at one end and all *recv* actions occur at the other.
Messages sent at one end can be eventually received at the other.
This very simple system is all we need to experiment with concurrency
and nondeterminism.

(This model program only models sending and receiving messages - it
does not model establishing or closing the connections.  To test a
real implementation, those operations must all be handled in the
stepper, see below.)

This model program uses *split actions*: it models each method call in
the socket API with *two* actions.  The socket *send* call is modeled
by *send_call* and *send_return*.  Both calls and returns are
represented as function calls with arguments but no return values.
The return value is represented as the argument of the return call.
For example, we model the call *s.call('bb')* that returns 2 (the
number of characters that were sent) with this pair of actions:

    send_call('bb')
    send_return(2)

Likewise *recv* is modeled by *recv_call* and *recv_return*.  For
example we model the call *r.recv(4)* that returns *'bb'* with this pair
of actions:

    recv_call(4)
    recv_return('bb')

Split actions make it possible to model concurrency and
nondeterminism.

### Concurrency ###

Concurrency arises from the simultaneous, unsynchronized sending and
receiving at the two ends of the connection.  PyModel represents
concurrency by *interleaving*.  Send and receive actions can
interleave without synchronization at the two ends of the connection.
Each end can send or receive while the other end is blocked.  Split
actions enable us to model this.  For example, we might see a trace
with these actions:

    recv_call(4)
    send_call('bb')
    send_return(2)
    recv_return('bb')

At the beginning of this trace, nothing has been sent yet.  The
receiver calls *recv* and blocks, because there is nothing to receive -
the buffers are empty.  Then the sender sends a message and returns,
so the receiver can read the message and return.  Here the receiver is
blocked from *recv_call* through *recv_return*, but while it is blocked
the sender can still run.

We say this trace exhibits *asynchronous* behavior because *recv_call*
is not immediately followed by *recv_return* - the *send* actions
intervene (even though *recv* is synchronous from the point of view of
the receiver, and *send* is synchronous from the point of view of the
sender).

### Nondeterminism ###

Nondeterminism arises from the unpredictable amount of data that may
be sent or received in each call.  The *send* operation may accept any
(incomplete) segment from the beginning of its message input, and the
*recv* operation may return any (incomplete) segment from the
beginning of the accumulated message segments that have been accepted
at the sender end.  Multiple *send* and *recv* calls might be needed to
transmit an entire message.

(more to come)


Restricting behavior
--------------------

The *msocket* model program in this sample exhibits nondeterminism and
asynchronous behavior.  However, these are rarely seen in the common
situation where a socket transmits small messages over a fast network
-- usually the entire message is transmitted in a single pair of
*send*/*recv* calls.  Therefore, sometimes we wish to restrict the
behavior of the model to deterministic, synchronous behaviors.

In PyModel, concurrency and asychrony permitted by a model program can
be removed by scenario machines, and nondeterminism can be removed
by domains.

### Removing concurrency ###

The *synchronous* module is a scenario machine, an FSM.  A graph of
this scenario appears in *Socket/svg/synchronous_graph.svg* (which you
can display in a browser).  As the graph shows, in this scenario
*send_call* is always immediately followed by *send_return*, and
*recv_call* is always immediately followed by *recv_return*.

Composing a model program with a scenario has the effect of
synchronizing them, so the model program can only execute sequences of
actions permitted by the scenario.  Here, composing the *msocket*
model program with the *synchronous* scenario machine has the effect
of merging the two parts of each split action into a single action.

Once *send* or *recv* is called, it always returns before another
action can begin - now the behavior is *synchronous*.  Moreover, in
this scenario one *send* is always followed by one *recv* - the
behavior is *sequential*.

### Removing nondeterminism ###

In a model program, the enabling condition for an action might permit
a large range of argument values, but the domain for that action can
limit it to a few, or just one.  Different domains can be written that
select different collections of arguments.  The *deterministic* module
is a PyModel configuration file that redefines the domains of
*send_return* and *recv_return*. 

Now *send_return* always accepts the entire argument of *send_call*
(not just a prefix), and *recv_return* always produces the entire
buffer contents (not just a prefix).  This has the effect of
deterministically transmitting the entire message from sender to
receiver in a single pair of *send*/*recv* calls.


Generating behavior
-------------------

The *test* module generates some samples of behavior that demonstrate
the *msocket* model program and the effects of the *synchronous* scenario
and *deterministic* configuration.

The *test* module is a test script that contains test cases that run
*pmt*, the PyModel tester.  The *pmt* command generates *traces* (test
runs), which are simply sequences of actions (function calls).  The
*pmt* command can optionally execute and check the test runs it
generates, but here we just generate the traces to get samples of
behavior to examine.  For this, we do not need a stepper (test
harness) because we do not need to connect the model to any socket
implementation.

To run the script and see the traces, type this command at the system
shell prompt:

    trun test

The first test case executes this command: 

    pmt -n 10 -c 6 msocket 

(you can also type this command yourself).  It generates a short (10
to 16 step) trace from the *msocket* module alone, so the trace may
exhibit nondeterminism and asynchrony, with interleaving *send* and
*recv* and incompletely sent messages.  

The messages (arguments to *send_call*) are limited to *'a'* and
*'bb'* by the domain in the *msocket* module.  This command chooses
actions and their arguments at random so repeating the command
generates different traces (to make runs repeatable, set the random
seed with the *-s* option).  To see longer traces, use a larger *-n*
option.  Omit the cleanup option *-c* to generate exactly *-n* steps,
which may stop in a non-accepting state (with a call in progress or a
message in flight).

The second test case executes: 

    pmt -n 10 -c 6 synchronous msocket

Including both the model program and a scenario machine as command
arguments forms their composition.  Now the run exhibits synchronous
behavior: each call is immediately followed by its return.  There is
no more blocking, no more interleaving of *send* and receive.  Moreover,
*send* and receive alternate, as dictated by the scenario machine.  But
the behavior may still be nondeterministic - incomplete messages may
be sent.

The third test case executes: 

    pmt -n 10 -c 6 deterministic synchronous msocket. 

This also includes the *deterministic* module, the configuration file
that reassigns domains to ensure that the entire message is always
sent and received immediately.


Visualizing behavior
--------------------

The *test_viewer* module generates graphs that illustrate the behavior
of the *msocket* model program and the effects of the *synchronous*
scenario and *deterministic* configuration.  To generate the graphs,
type this command: 

    trun test_viewer

The *test_viewer* module is a test script that runs *pmv*, the PyModel
viewer.  The *pmv* program in turn invokes *pma*, the PyModel analyzer,
and pmg, the PyModel graphics program, and dot, a rendering program.
The *pma* program performs an analysis called *exploration* which
generates a finite state machine (FSM) from the model, and pmg
generates a file of graphics commands in the dot language from the
FSM.  Finally, the dot program renders the output of pmg in a chosen
graphics format.  This script generates *.svg* files, which you can view
in a browser. (Older versions of IE did not display *.svg* files - has
MS fixed this?).

The *test_viewer* module generates four *.svg* files, which are in the
*Socket/svg* directory:

The graph in *socketFSM.svg* is generated by the command: 

    pmv msocket.  

It shows a graph of an FSM generated by exploring the *msocket* model
program.  Every node in the graph represents a program state (hover
the cursor over a node to show the state variables and their values).
Every edge in the graph represents an action (every edge is labeled
with the function call including its argument).  Every path through
this FSM describes a trace that the model can execute --- runs
generated by the first test case in the test module are examples.
Multiple edges emerging from a node indicate nondeterminism, and every
*call* edge not immediately followed by a *return* edge indicates
asynchrony.

The graph in *synchronous_graph.svg* is generated by the command: 

    pmv -o synchronous_graph synchronous.  

It is the graph of the *synchronous* scenario machine, an FSM.

The graph in *synchronousFSM.svg* is generated by the command: 

    pmv synchronous socket  

It is a graph of the *msocket* model program composed with the
*synchronous* scenario machine.  Paths through this FSM include the runs
generated by the second test case in the test module.  Notice that
every *call* is followed by *return*, and every *send* is followed by *recv*.
But, there is still nondeterminism in action arguments.

The graph in *deterministicFSM.svg* is generated by the command: 

    pmv deterministic  synchronous msocket.  

It is a graph of the *msocket* model program composed with the
*synchronous* scenario machine, using the domains in the
*deterministic* module.

Stepper modules
---------------

A PyModel stepper is a test harness (sometimes called an adapter) that
connects a model (here, the `msocket` module) to a an implementation
(here, the Python standard library socket module).  A stepper enables
the PyModel tester `pmt` to use a model to call methods in the
implementation and check the results.

The PyModel Socket sample contains several steppers that demonstrate
different technques.  All of these socket steppers handle *both* ends of the
socket connection so they can test both `send` and `recv` (recall that the
model program `msocket` always sends at one end of the connection and
receives at the other).  And, they do this in a single ordinary
process (Python program invocation) on the local machine.  They
accomplish this by connecting to both ends of a socket on localhost
and interleaving calls to `send` and `recv`.

In `experiments.txt` we discuss the several steppers, in the order we wrote
them: `stepper_d` (formerly stepper), `stepper_o`, `stepper_a`, and stepper
(formerly `stepper_s`).  Each improves on its predecessors.  The last
one, stepper, is now the recommended one.  It is the only one we
discuss here.

The stepper module
------------------

(The stepper module was originally called `stepper_s`, but was renamed
to just stepper to indicate that it is now the preferred stepper
module for the socket sample.)

The stepper module supports nondeterminism and asynchrony.  

This stepper distinguishes between controllable and observable
actions.  Controllable actions can be invoked in the implementation by
the test runner `pmt` (via the stepper).  Here `send_call` and recv_call are
the controllable actions.  Observable actions cannot be invoked by the
test runner; they are generated by the implementation and passed back
to `pmt` (via stepper).  Here `send_return` and `recv_return` are the
observable actions.  The observable actions must be identified in the
model program module or a configuration module; here they are
indentified in the configuration module `observables.py`.

This stepper executes and checks test runs in this way.  First we
describe the simpler situation where the socket connection does not
block (that is, where its buffers are ready).  For each controllable
action (for example `recv_call`), the test runner `pmt` calls the action
in the `msocket` model (which may update the model state).  Then it
passes the action to this stepper, which calls the corresponding
method (s.recv) in the implementation.  Then this stepper collects the
result (data) from the implementation and constructs the corresponding
observable action (`recv_return`) where the result appears as an
argument.  Then this stepper appends this action to observation_queue,
where `pmt` can retrieve it.  Then `pmt` finds that action in the
observation queue, removes it, and checks it (including the msg
argument) with its enabling condition (`recv_return`_enabled).  If the
enabling condition returns False, the test fails.  If the enabling
condition returns True, `pmt` executes the observable action in the
model (possibly updating the model state) and the test continues.  If
the test run reaches the end and none of the actions have failed, the
test passes.

Asynchrony arises when the socket connection buffers are not ready, so
attempting to read or write at the socket would block.  In this
stepper this situation is handled by the `select` function.  (The
`stepper_a` module in this sample is similar but solves the same problem
with threads, see `experiments.txt`.).  This stepper always calls `select`
before attempting to `send` or `recv` on the socket.  The return values
from `select` indicate when the attempt would block; in those cases, the
stepper does not call `send` or `recv`, so no blocking occurs.  Instead,
this stepper simply returns None to the caller `pmt`, to indicate that
the test did not fail.  This enables `pmt` to proceed and periodically
repeat making calls to this stepper, until eventually the `select`
function might indicate that buffers are ready.

Notice that this stepper does *not* determine whether each step in the
test passes or fails, and it does not construct the message describing
the failure.  Instead, this stepper merely collects the response,
constructs and observable action, and passes it back to `pmt`.  It is
the test runner `pmt` that determines whether the test passes or fails,
and writes the message describing the failure.  This is a very
important difference between this stepper and `stepper_d` in this sample
(discussed in `experiments.txt`).  The organization used by this stepper
delegates more work to the test runner `pmt`, where it need not be
rewritten for each implementation.  It is also more general, since it
handles both nondeterminism and concurrency in the enabling conditions
for the observable actions, so it is recommended for systems that
exhibit nondeterminism and concurrency.  This style does require the
model to be written with split actions, which might be a disadvantage
for simple systems.

This stepper (or any other stepper that uses observable actions)
cannot be driven from a test suite (which specifies every action in
the test run), but can only be used for on-the-fly testing (where the
implemention generates the observable actions).


The test_stepper script
-----------------------

The `test_stepper` module is a test script that contains a single
test case that invokes a run with the stepper module.


The socket_simulator module
---------------------------

The `socket_simulator` module is a replacement for the Python standard
library socket module to use with the PyModel socket sample, to
demonstrate nondeterminism and blocking even with small messages.

The simulated socket here may nondeterministically send or receive just
part of the message, no matter how short the message (even just two
characters).

The simulated socket here blocks on `send` when the buffer is full, and
blocks on `recv` when the buffer is empty.  The buffer can be made very
small, by assigning the bufsize variable.  The default bufsize is 3
characters.

Note that this *same* socket simulator is used with `stepper_a`,
which achieves asynchrony with threads, and stepper which achieves
asynchrony with `select`.  When `stepper` imports this `socket_simulator`,
`stepper` must also import `select_simulator`.

This socket simulator can also be used with the synchronous stepper,
but it may block -- just like a real socket.

To use this simulator, just put it in the same directory with your
PyModel socket steppers and rename it (or symlink it) to `socket.py`.
The steppers will load this simulator instead of the Python standard
library socket module.  If you want to use this simulator with
stepper, you must also rename (or symlink) `select_simulator.py` to 
`select.py`.

To demonstrate the simulator, replace the standard library socket
module (as described in the previous paragraph) and execute any of the
`test_stepper` modules.

You will see that the socket behaves nondeterministically.  Now
`send_return` sometimes returns a number smaller than the length of the
msg argument to `send_call`.  For example, send_call('bb'), is sometimes
followed by send_return(1,) (not always send_return(2,)) and the
following `recv_return` often returns fewer characters than have been
sent, `'b'` not `'bb'`.  

You will also see that the simulated socket connection blocks when the
buffer is full or empty.  When the (quite small) buffer is full,
`send_call` is not immediately followed by `send_return`.  Instead,
`recv_return` must execute first, in order to free some space in the
buffer.  Likewise, `recv` blocks when the buffer is empty, and cannot
return until `send_return` leaves a message in the buffer.  If you are
using `stepper_a`, you may notice pauses when these blocks occur.  If
you are using the synchronous `stepper_d`, you may see the entire `pmt`
session block and not resume.  The only escape from this is to type
^C.
