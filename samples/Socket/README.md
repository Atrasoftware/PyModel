PyModel socket sample
=====================

This sample uses network sockets to demonstrate several PyModel
techniques for modeling and testing systems that exhibit
nondeterminism, concurrency, and asynchrony.

In this sample we model and test the Python standard library
[*socket*](http://docs.python.org/2/library/socket.html) module.  We
don't expect any test failures!  This sample includes a simulator that
can replace the standard *socket* module with a substitute that can be
configured to exhibit failures.  (The simulator is more often
used to demonstrate more nondeterminism than is usually seen in
typical sockets.)

More detailed explanation of this sample appears in *socket.txt* and
*socket_experiments.txt* in the *notes* directory.  This file uses
concepts and vocabulary defined in
[*concepts.txt*](../../notes/concepts.txt) in the *notes* directory
(also *concepts.html* in the *www* directory).

Motivation
----------

Socket behavior can be more complicated than expected, because data
are buffered on each end, and may be transported through the network
at an irregular rate.  Nondeterminism arises from the unpredictable
amount of data that may be sent or received in each call.  Concurrency
arises from the simultaneous, unsynchronized sending and receiving at
the two ends of the connection.  For more explanation of socket
behavior, see:

 http://docs.python.org/howto/sockets.html

 http://pyvideo.org/video/885/through-the-ether-and-back-again-what-happens-to

This sample demonstrates how to use PyModel to model and test this
behavior, including its nondeterminism and concurrency.

Socket sample contents
----------------------

The sample includes several modules.  In this README we discuss these:

- *msocket*: a model program for network sockets that can exhibit
  nondeterminism and concurrency.

- *synchronous*, *deterministic*: a scenario machine and a
  configuration file that remove the asynchronous, nondeterministic
  behaviors of the *msocket* model program.

- *stepper*: a PyModel stepper (also called a test harness or adapter)
  that uses the *msocket* model program (and optionally, scenarios and
  configurations) to test actual sockets on *localhost* (via the Python
  standard library socket module).  Also, *stepper_util*, code used by
  the stepper.

- *observables*: a configuration file used with the stepper to indicate
  which actions in the *msocket* model program it should consider
  observable (the remaining actions are considered controllable).

- *test*, *test_viewer*, *test_stepper*: test scripts that invoke various
  combinations of these modules.

- *socket_simulator* and *select_simulator*: simulators that can
  optionally replace the Python standard library *socket* and *select*
  modules in the steppers.  The simulators can be configured to
  demonstrate a great deal of nondeterminism and concurrency, even
  with small messages.

- *fsmpy/* and *svg/* directories that contain finite state machine
  modules and graphics files generated by the test scripts from the
  *msocket* model and its scenarios and configurations.

Some other modules that also appear in this sample are explained in
*notes/socket_experiments.txt*.

Socket model program
--------------------

The model program in the [*msocket*](msocket.py) module models *both*
ends of the connection.  Here we model a system where one end of the
connection is always the sender and the other end is always the
receiver: all *send* actions occur at one end and all *recv* actions
occur at the other.  Messages sent at one end can be eventually
received at the other.  This very simple system is all we need to
experiment with concurrency and nondeterminism.

(This model program only models sending and receiving messages - it
does not model establishing or closing the connections.  To test a
real implementation, those operations must all be handled in the
stepper, see below.)

This model program uses *split actions*: it models each method call in
the socket API with *two* actions.  The socket *send* call is modeled
by *send_call* and *send_return*.  Both calls and returns are
represented as function calls with arguments but no return values.
The return value is represented as the argument of the return call.
For example, we model the call *s.call('bb')* that returns 2 (the
number of characters that were sent) with this pair of actions:

    send_call('bb')
    send_return(2)

Likewise *recv* is modeled by *recv_call* and *recv_return*.  For
example we model the call *r.recv(4)* that returns *'bb'* with this pair
of actions:

    recv_call(4)
    recv_return('bb')

Split actions make it possible to model concurrency and
nondeterminism.

### Concurrency ###

For sockets, concurrency arises from the simultaneous, unsynchronized
sending and receiving at the two ends of the connection.  PyModel
represents concurrency by *interleaving*.  Send and receive actions
can interleave without synchronization at the two ends of the
connection.  Each end can send or receive while the other end is
blocked.  

Split actions enable us to model this.  For example, we
might see a trace with these actions:

    recv_call(4)
    send_call('bb')
    send_return(2)
    recv_return('bb')

At the beginning of this trace, nothing has been sent yet.  The
receiver calls *recv* and blocks, because there is nothing to receive -
the buffers are empty.  Then the sender sends a message and returns,
so the receiver can read the message and return.  Here the receiver is
blocked from *recv_call* through *recv_return*, but while it is blocked
the sender can still run.

We say this trace exhibits *asynchronous* behavior because *recv_call*
is not immediately followed by *recv_return* - the *send* actions
intervene (even though *recv* is synchronous from the point of view of
the receiver, and *send* is synchronous from the point of view of the
sender).

### Nondeterminism ###

For sockets, nondeterminism arises from the unpredictable amount of
data that may be sent or received in each call.  The *send* operation
may accept any (incomplete) segment from the beginning of its message
input, and the *recv* operation may return any (incomplete) segment
from the beginning of the accumulated message segments that have been
accepted at the sender end.  Multiple *send* and *recv* calls might be
needed to transmit an entire message.

In PyModel model programs, nondeterminism is implemented by *enabling
conditions*.  Each action (for example *send_call*) has a
corresponding enabling condition (for example *send_call_enabled*), a
boolean function of the action arguments and the model program state.
When generating behavior, PyModel can call the action whenever the
combination of arguments satisfies the enabling condition in the
current state.  When checking behavior, PyModel allows actions that
satisfy their enabling conditions, but considers an action that
violates its enabling condition to be a test failure.

The actual action arguments that are used are drawn from *domains*
defined in the model program (or in a configuration module).  To
choose the next action (when generating behavior), PyModel considers
all combinations from the domains (for all actions) and chooses a
combination that satisfies the enabling condition.  Often, several
different actions (and argument combinations) are enabled in the same
state, so the resulting behavior is nondeterministic.

Split actions enable us to model nondetermistic return values.  The
*return* actions in the model also have enabling conditions, and these
can be coded to exhibit nondeterminism.  In the *msocket* model
program, the enabling condition for *send_return* is coded to allow
PyModel to nondeterministically choose any value for *n* (the number
of characters acceped by *send*) that is not larger than *msg* (the
argument of *send*).  The enabling condition for *recv_return* allows
any value for *msg* (the message returned by *recv*) that is an
initial segment of the messages sent so far.  The enabling conditions
for the *return* actions are, in effect, the postconditions for those
operations --- which can be nondeterministic, if the conditions are
coded to allow that.


Restricting behavior
--------------------

The *msocket* model program in this sample exhibits nondeterminism and
asynchronous behavior.  However, these are rarely seen in the common
situation where a socket transmits small messages over a fast network
-- usually the entire message is transmitted in a single pair of
*send*, *recv* calls.  Therefore, sometimes we wish to restrict the
behavior of the model to deterministic, synchronous behaviors.

In PyModel, concurrency and asychrony permitted by a model program can
be removed by scenario machines, and nondeterminism can be removed
by domains.

### Removing concurrency ###

The [*synchronous*](synchronous.py) module is a scenario machine, an
FSM.  A graph of this scenario appears in
[*Socket/svg/synchronous_graph.svg*](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jon-jacky/PyModel/blob/pymodel-asynch/samples/Socket/svg/synchronous_graph.svg) 
(which you can display in a browser).  As the graph shows, in this
scenario *send_call* is always immediately followed by *send_return*,
and *recv_call* is always immediately followed by *recv_return*.

Composing a model program with a scenario has the effect of
synchronizing them, so the model program can only execute sequences of
actions permitted by the scenario.  Here, composing the *msocket*
model program with the *synchronous* scenario machine has the effect
of merging the two parts of each split action into a single action.

Once *send* or *recv* is called, it always returns before another
action can begin - now the behavior is *synchronous*.  Moreover, in
this scenario one *send* is always followed by one *recv* - the
behavior is *sequential*.

### Removing nondeterminism ###

In a model program, the enabling condition for an action might permit
a large range of argument values, but the domain for that action can
limit it to a few, or just one.  Different domains can be written that
select different collections of arguments.  The
[*deterministic*](deterministic.py) module is a PyModel configuration
file that redefines the domains of *send_return* and *recv_return*.

Now *send_return* always accepts the entire argument of *send_call*
(not just a prefix), and *recv_return* always produces the entire
buffer contents (not just a prefix).  This has the effect of
deterministically transmitting the entire message from sender to
receiver in a single pair of *send*/*recv* calls.


Generating behavior
-------------------

The [*test*](test.py) module generates some samples of behavior that
demonstrate the *msocket* model program and the effects of the
*synchronous* scenario and *deterministic* configuration.

The *test* module is a test script that contains test cases that run
*pmt*, the PyModel tester.  The *pmt* command generates *traces* (test
runs), which are simply sequences of actions (function calls).  The
*pmt* command can optionally execute and check the test runs it
generates, but here we just generate the traces to get samples of
behavior to examine.  For this, we do not need a stepper (test
harness) because we do not need to connect the model to any socket
implementation.

To run the script and see the traces, type this command at the system
shell prompt:

    trun test

The first test case executes this command: 

    pmt -n 10 -c 6 msocket 

(you can also type this command yourself).  It generates a short (10
to 16 step) trace from the *msocket* module alone, so the trace may
exhibit nondeterminism and asynchrony, with interleaving *send* and
*recv* and incompletely sent messages.  

The messages (arguments to *send_call*) are limited to *'a'* and
*'bb'* by the domain in the *msocket* module.  This command chooses
actions and their arguments at random so repeating the command
generates different traces (to make runs repeatable, set the random
seed with the *-s* option).  To see longer traces, use a larger *-n*
option.  Omit the cleanup option *-c* to generate exactly *-n* steps,
which may stop in a non-accepting state (with a call in progress or a
message in flight).

The second test case executes: 

    pmt -n 10 -c 6 synchronous msocket

Including both the model program and a scenario machine as command
arguments forms their composition.  Now the run exhibits synchronous
behavior: each call is immediately followed by its return.  There is
no more blocking, no more interleaving of *send* and receive.  Moreover,
*send* and receive alternate, as dictated by the scenario machine.  But
the behavior may still be nondeterministic - incomplete messages may
be sent.

The third test case executes: 

    pmt -n 10 -c 6 deterministic synchronous msocket

This also includes the *deterministic* module, the configuration file
that reassigns domains to ensure that the entire message is always
sent and received immediately.


Visualizing behavior
--------------------

The [*test_viewer*](test_viewer.py) module generates graphs that
illustrate the behavior of the *msocket* model program and the effects
of the *synchronous* scenario and *deterministic* configuration.  To
generate the graphs, type this command:

    trun test_viewer

The *test_viewer* module is a test script that runs *pmv*, the PyModel
viewer.  The *pmv* program in turn invokes *pma*, the PyModel analyzer,
and *pmg*, the PyModel graphics program, and *dot*, a rendering program.
The *pma* program performs an analysis called *exploration* which
generates a finite state machine (FSM) from the model, and *pmg*
generates a file of graphics commands in the *dot* language from the
FSM.  Finally, the *dot* program renders the output of *pmg* in a chosen
graphics format.  This script generates *.svg* files, which you can view
in a browser. (Older versions of IE did not display *.svg* files - has
MS fixed this?).

The *test_viewer* module generates four *.svg* files, which are in the
*Socket/svg* directory:

The graph in [*msocketFSM.svg*](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jon-jacky/PyModel/blob/pymodel-asynch/samples/Socket/svg/msocketFSM.svg) is generated by the command:

    pmv msocket

It shows a graph of an FSM generated by exploring the *msocket* model
program.  Every node in the graph represents a program state (hover
the cursor over a node to show the state variables and their values).
Every edge in the graph represents an action (every edge is labeled
with the function call including its argument).  Every path through
this FSM describes a trace that the model can execute --- runs
generated by the first test case in the test module are examples.
Multiple edges emerging from a node indicate nondeterminism, and every
*call* edge not immediately followed by a *return* edge indicates
asynchrony.

The graph in [*synchronous_graph.svg*](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jon-jacky/PyModel/blob/pymodel-asynch/samples/Socket/svg/synchronous_graph.svg) is generated by the command:

    pmv -o synchronous_graph synchronous

It is the graph of the *synchronous* scenario machine, an FSM.

The graph in [*synchronousFSM.svg*](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jon-jacky/PyModel/blob/pymodel-asynch/samples/Socket/svg/synchronousFSM.svg) is generated by the command: 

    pmv synchronous socket  

It is a graph of the *msocket* model program composed with the
*synchronous* scenario machine.  Paths through this FSM include the runs
generated by the second test case in the test module.  Notice that
every *call* is followed by *return*, and every *send* is followed by *recv*.
But, there is still nondeterminism in action arguments.

The graph in [*deterministicFSM.svg*](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/jon-jacky/PyModel/blob/pymodel-asynch/samples/Socket/svg/deterministicFSM.svg) is generated by the command:

    pmv deterministic synchronous msocket

It is a graph of the *msocket* model program composed with the
*synchronous* scenario machine, using the domains in the
*deterministic* module.

On-the-fly testing
------------------

The usual approach to testing drives the module under test with a
predefined sequence of function calls, then checks whether the module
returns a particular set of expected results.  This is called *offline
testing* because the test sequence and the expected results are
scripted in advance.  

Clearly, offline testing cannot work for nondeterministic systems.
Instead, we use *on-the-fly testing*, where the function calls are
generated and checked as the test executes.  On-the-fly testing
requires that we identify the *controllable actions* and *observable
actions*.

*Controllable actions* can be invoked in the implementation by the
PyModel test runner *pmt*, via a *stepper* (or *test harness*).  In
this socket sample, *send_call* and *recv_call* are the controllable
actions.

*Observable actions* cannot be invoked by the test runner; they are
generated by the socket implementation, captured by the stepper, and
passed back to *pmt*.  Here *send_return* and *recv_return* are the
observable actions.  The observable actions must be identified in the
model program module or a configuration module; here they are
indentified in the [*observables*](observables.py) configuration
module.


Stepper module
--------------

A PyModel *stepper* is a *test harness* (sometimes called an
*adapter*) that connects a model (here, the *msocket* module) to a an
implementation (here, the Python standard library *socket* module).  A
stepper enables the PyModel tester *pmt* to use a model to call
methods in the implementation and check the results.

The [*stepper*](stepper.py) module is our preferred stepper for the
Socket sample.  The [*test_stepper*](test_stepper.py) module is a test
script that contains a single test case that invokes a run with the
stepper module.

The *stepper* module handles *both* ends of the socket connection,
so it can test both *send* and *recv*.  And, it does this in a single
ordinary process (Python program invocation) on the local machine.  It
accomplishes this by connecting to both ends of a socket on localhost
and interleaving calls to *send* and *recv*.

The *stepper* module supports nondeterminism and asynchrony.
It distinguishes between controllable and observable actions.  Here is
how the stepper executes and checks test runs.  First we describe the
simpler situation where the socket connection does not block (that is,
where its buffers are ready).  For each controllable action, for
example *recv_call*:

- The test runner *pmt* calls the action in the *msocket* model (which
may update the model state).

- *pmt* passes the controllable action to *stepper*, which calls the
corresponding method *s.recv* in the implementation (the Python
standard library *socket* module).

- *stepper* collects the result (data) from the implementation and
constructs the corresponding observable action *recv_return* where
the result appears as an argument.  

- *stepper* appends this action to the *observation queue*, where
*pmt* can retrieve it.

- *pmt* finds that action in the *observation queue*, removes it, and
checks it (including the *msg* argument) with its enabling condition
*recv_return_enabled*.

- If the enabling condition returns *False*, the test fails.  

- If the enabling condition returns *True*, *pmt* executes the
observable action in the model (possibly updating the model state) and
the test continues.

- If the test run reaches the end and none of the actions
have failed, the test passes.

Asynchrony arises when the socket connection buffers are not ready, so
attempting to read or write at the socket would block.  This situation
is handled by the Python standard library *select* function.  The
stepper always calls *select* before attempting to *send* or *recv* on
the socket.

The return values from *select* indicate when the attempt would block;
in those cases, the stepper does not call *send* or *recv*, so no
blocking occurs.  Instead, this stepper simply returns *None* to the
caller *pmt*, to indicate that the test did not fail.  This enables
*pmt* to proceed, and continue executing the model and making calls to
the stepper.  Usually, one of these calls will eventually result in
unblocking the socket. Then the *select* function can indicate that
buffers are ready, and *send* or *recv* can be called as described
above.

Notice that this stepper does *not* determine whether each step in the
test passes or fails, and it does not construct the message describing
the failure.  Instead, this stepper merely collects the response,
constructs an observable action, and passes it back to *pmt*.  It is
the test runner *pmt* that determines whether the test passes or fails,
and writes the message describing the failure.  

This kind of stepper (which uses observable actions) cannot be driven
from a offline test script which specifies every action in the test run, but
can only be used for on-the-fly testing (where the implementation
generates the observable actions).

This kind of stepper is recommended for systems that exhibit
nondeterminism and concurrency.  This style does require the model to
be written with split actions, which might be a disadvantage for
simple systems.  This sample also includes steppers written in
different styles, but they are not as versatile. (They are discussed
in *socket_experiments.txt*.)


Simulating sockets
------------------

The [*socket_simulator*](socket_simulator.py) and
[*select_simulator*](select_simulator.py) modules are replacements for
the Python standard library *socket* and *select* modules to use with
the PyModel socket sample, to demonstrate nondeterminism and blocking
even with small messages.

The simulated socket here may nondeterministically send or receive just
part of the message, no matter how short the message (even just two
characters).

The simulated socket here blocks on *send* when the buffer is full, and
blocks on *recv* when the buffer is empty.  The buffer can be made very
small, by assigning the bufsize variable.  The default bufsize is 3
characters.

To use this simulator, just put *socket_simulator.py* in the same
directory with your PyModel socket steppers and rename it (or symlink
it) to *socket.py*.  You must also rename (or symlink)
*select_simulator.py* to *select.py*.  Then, you may execute any of
the tests.

You will see that the socket behaves nondeterministically.  Now
*send_return* sometimes returns a number smaller than the length of the
msg argument to *send_call*.  For example, *send_call('bb')*, is sometimes
followed by *send_return(1,)* (not always *send_return(2,)*) and the
*recv_return* which follows often returns fewer characters than have been
sent, *'b'* not *'bb'*.  

You will also see that the simulated socket connection blocks when the
buffer is full or empty.  When the (quite small) buffer is full,
*send_call* is not immediately followed by *send_return*.  Instead,
*recv_return* must execute first, in order to free some space in the
buffer.  Likewise, *recv* blocks when the buffer is empty, and cannot
return until *send_return* leaves a message in the buffer.
