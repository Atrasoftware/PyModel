To use PyModel, you do not need to install anything into any system
directories.  Just obtain the PyModel directory and place it at any
convenient location.  To get the current development version,

 git clone git@github.com:jon-jacky/PyModel.git

To get version 1.0, download PyModel-1.0.tar.gz or PyModel-1.0.zip
from

 https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyModel 

or 

 http://staff.washington.edu/jon/pymodel/www/

Then unpack ...

... execute pymodel_paths ...  rename PyModel-1.0 to just PyModel (or 
edit the commands) ...

The setup.py script now supports the install argument, to optionally
install the PyModel python modules and commands in system directories.

... source tpath ...

... install does not do anything with samples or docs ...
