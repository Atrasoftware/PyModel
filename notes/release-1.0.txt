PyModel v 1.0 release notes

PyModel is a model-based testing framework for Python.  Earlier public
releases were versions 0.80 in Jan 2010, 0.85 in Mar 2010, and 0.90 in
July 2011.  Since July 2011 ongoing work has been available at GitHub:
https://github.com/jon-jacky/PyModel/  

This release is called version 1.0 because it includes all of the
features considered in the original project plan.  (Development and
maintenance will continue beyond this release.)

Version 1.0 adds new functionality:

- The PyModel Tester pmt supports observable actions and asynchronous
  steppers, to handle event-driven systems and nondeterminism.

- The PyModel Analyzer pma performs safety analysis by checking state
  invariants.  The PyModel Graphics program pmg indicates unsafe states
  in the generated graphs.

- The new PyModel Viewer command combines the functionality of the
  PyModel Analyzer pma, the PyModel Graphics program pmg, and the
  Graphviz dot program in a single command, for convenience and
  brevity.

- The options to include or exclude actions, -a and -e, are now
  supported for FSMs and TestSuites as well as Model Programs, so you
  can use the command line to select which actions to include in your
  analyses or tests, even when you compose model programs with
  scenario machines.

- The tester pmt provides a timeout option to specify that the test
  fails if the implementation does not respond within a given
  deadline.  (This option might not work on Windows.)

- The PyModel programs pma, pmg, pmt, and pmv can be run from the
  command line without the .py extension, like any other command.
  You can just type pmt ... , you no longer have to type pmt.py ... 

Version 1.0 adds a new sample and revises all the others:

- Socket sample and writeup, asynch steppers using threads or
  select, socket_simulator and select_simulator

- Especially, more documentation for the samples: samples/README.md
  and README.md in each samples directory that explains every file

- svg/ and fsmpy/ dirs new .ref files, 

Version 1.0 reorganizes some code and directory structure:

- new bin directory separated from pymodel directory

- separate out models.py base class for ModelProgram, FSM, TestSuite

Version 1.0 adds new documentation and revises much of the rest:

- More documentation New README.md files in PyModel in most top-level
 directories below PyModel

- Revised .txt files in notes/

- Revised .html files in www/, new .html files generated from new .md
  files in other directories

Version 1.0 makes some bug fixes:

- fix crash when missing parameter generator, now print
          helpful error msg and exit cleanly

- cancel timeout when timeout was requested but didn't expire

- Correctly handle empty args in composition

- pmt -o offline test generator option
