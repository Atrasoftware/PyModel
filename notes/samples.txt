PyModel Samples

There are some examples in the subdirectories under the pymodel samples
directory: ABP, Marquee, PowerSwitch, Socket, Stack, WebApplication, etc.

Each sample subdirectory contains some test script modules: test.py,
test_scenarios.py, test_graphics.py etc.  Each of these test scripts
contains commented command lines that demonstrate combinations of
arguments and options.

To prepare to execute test scripts, put the pymodel directory (that
contains trun.py, pma.py etc.) on your execution path.  Then in each
samples directory, put the current directory (whatever it is) on the
PYTHONPATH by executing the tpath command ("source tpath" in bash,
just "tpath" in Windows).

To execute all the commands in a test script, run it with trun.py:

 trun.py test

 trun.py test_scenarios 

 (etc.)

Or, you can type individual commands that you find in the test
scripts, or try your own variations.

The test_graphics scripts run the analyzer and graphics programs, and
generate FSM modules and SVG files that can be displayed by a browser.

If you are using a Unix-like system (including Linux or Mac OS X), you
can just type trun ... instead of trun.py ..., and likewise for all
PyModel commands: pmt ... instead of pmt.py ... etc.  To make that
work, you must execute the symlink command in the pymodel directory
