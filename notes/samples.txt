PyModel Samples

There are some examples in the subdirectories under the pymodel samples
directory: ABP, Marquee, PowerSwitch, Socket, Stack, WebApplication, etc.

Each sample subdirectory contains some test script modules: test.py,
test_graphics.py etc.  These scripts demonstrate the samples, as well
as testing PyModel itself.  The file test.txt provides detailed
instructions for running the scripts.

Each test script contains commented command lines that demonstrate
combinations of arguments and options.  Running each test script
displays output on the terminal, and many test scripts also generate
files of graphic output in .svg, .pdf, or .ps format. The graphics
files can then be displayed by an appropriate viewer (for example,
.svg files can be displayed by many browsers).

Some samples directories contain svg/ subdirectories (etc.) with test
output files that we computed on our development system, so you can
view them without having to execute the tests scripts yourself.
(Executing the test scripts will not overwrite the contents of these
directories.)
