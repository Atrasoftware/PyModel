* *samples.txt*: where to find the samples and how to run them

* *models.txt*: how to write and use model programs, FSMs, and test suites

* *composition.txt*: how and why to use composition to combine models

* *strategy.txt*: how to select or write an optional strategy to guide test runs

* *stepper.txt*: how to write the test harness needed to test an implementation

* *test.txt*: how to script and run tests on the PyModel software itself

* *advice.txt*: miscellaneous tips and advice

* *socket_experiments.txt*: steppers and other files in the socket sample that
                          are not discussed in its *README*

* *releases.txt*: release history 

* *release-0.85.txt*: release notes

* *release-0.9.txt*: release notes

See also the *README* files in some directories, the slides and papers
